# Quick Translate

Select any text in the editor, click the marker that appears, and read the
Google Translate result in a popup without leaving VS Code — the same gesture as
the Google Translate extension in Chrome.

## Getting started

Nothing to configure. Select a piece of text and a 🌐 marker appears after it.
Click that marker and a small popup asks what it is about to translate; click
**Translate** in it and the result opens. The marker waits for the mouse button
to come up, so it never chases the pointer while you are still dragging out the
selection.

Text already translated in this session skips the question — it costs nothing
to answer again, so one click on the marker opens the result.

Prefer the Chrome behaviour of opening on hover? That is one setting away —
see [Click or hover](#click-or-hover).

While the request is out the popup carries a spinner, the marker turns into ⏳,
and a `Translating…` indicator appears in the status bar. The spinner always
stays up for a moment even when the answer arrives sooner, so it reads as
progress rather than as a flicker.

A hover cannot be updated in place, so that spinner is a popup of its own that
has to be torn down and reopened around the answer. On a fast connection the
two can read as a flash. `spinnerAfterDelay` is the head start a request gets
before the spinner is opened at all: raise it and anything that finishes first
opens once, with the translation already in it.

The marker only follows selections you made with the mouse or the keyboard.
Stepping through Find matches re-selects on every hit, and marking each one
would be noise — those selections are left alone. `Cmd+Alt+T` still translates
whatever is selected, however it got selected.

Translation is deliberate by design: nothing is sent until you click, so a
stray mouse movement cannot spend quota. Text already translated in this
session never reaches the network again — it opens straight from the cache.

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Select text, click the 🌐 marker, click **Translate** | The translation popup opens |
| `Cmd+Alt+T` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Alt+T` | Open the popup immediately, without the marker |
| `Cmd+Alt+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` | Translate and **replace** the selection in place |
| Click the status bar item (`🌐 auto → vi`) | Change the target language |
| Right-click the selection | Translate commands in the context menu |

## Inside the popup

The popup is laid out as three sections divided by rules: the language pair on
top, the original text, then the translation.

Each block carries its own small toolbar:

| Button | Does |
|---|---|
| 🔊 | Play the text through Google's text-to-speech in your browser |
| ↗ | Open the original on translate.google.com |
| 📋 Copy | Copy the translation to the clipboard |
| ⇄ Replace | Replace the selected text with the translation |

Line breaks in the source are preserved: each line is translated on its own and
rendered on its own line, so a multi-line comment keeps its shape.

## The Translations panel

The 🌐 icon in the **Secondary Side Bar** — the right-hand strip Claude Code
and Copilot Chat live in — opens a transcript of everything translated so far,
newest at the bottom. Set `panelLocation` to `activitybar` to put it on the
left instead, or just drag the view across; the workbench remembers where you
leave it. Every translation is recorded there whichever way it
was made — marker, keybinding, context menu — so the panel is a scrollback the
popup cannot be.

At the bottom is a box for text that is not in any editor: paste or type,
press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and the answer joins the transcript. <kbd>Shift</kbd>
+<kbd>Enter</kbd> makes a new line instead.

Point at any turn for its tools: copy the translation, hear it, open it on
translate.google.com, or run it again against the current language pair. The
header carries the same language pair as the status bar and changes it the same
way.

`historySize` (`50`) caps the transcript; the oldest turns fall off the top.
`Translate: Clear Translation History` and the panel's own **Clear** button
empty it.

### Keeping GitLens out of the translation

A hover popup is not the extension's to own. VS Code hands the one hover widget
to *every* extension that answers the position it was asked at, stacked in one
list — and the column past the last character of a line is exactly where
GitLens answers with its commit card. Select a comment that runs to end of line
and the popup opens with a commit above the translation.

Three ways out, in increasing order of how much they change:

1. Leave `popupPosition` on `auto`. The popup opens at the *front* of a
   selection that ends at end of line, which is outside the column GitLens
   answers at. This is the default and costs nothing.
2. Set `showResultIn` to `panel`. No popup is opened at all — the answer goes
   to the Translations panel, which is a webview and therefore the extension's
   alone. Nothing can draw in it.
3. Turn GitLens' line hovers off: `gitlens.hovers.currentLine.details` for the
   commit card, `gitlens.hovers.currentLine.changes` for the diff block, or
   `gitlens.hovers.currentLine.enabled` for both. The inline blame annotation
   stays.

Where the popup *is* opened, the translation is now ranked above the commit
card rather than under it, so option 1 and 3 are about tidiness rather than
about being able to read the answer at all.

## Click or hover

`quickTranslate.popupTrigger` decides what opens the popup. It ships as
`click`; set it to `hover` for the Chrome-style gesture.

Through the UI: **Cmd+,** (**Ctrl+,** on Windows/Linux) → search
`popupTrigger` → pick from the dropdown. The palette command
`Translate: Extension Options` jumps straight to this extension's settings.

Or in `settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  // Point at the marker instead of clicking it
  "quickTranslate.popupTrigger": "hover"
}
```

Both modes run the same two steps — the marker's own popup asks first, the
translation opens second. They differ only in what brings up the first one.

| | `click` (default) | `hover` |
|---|---|---|
| Opens the confirmation popup | Clicking the 🌐 marker | Resting the pointer on the marker |
| Pointing at the marker | Does nothing | Opens the confirmation popup |
| `confirmBeforeTranslate` | Turning it off makes one click on the marker open the translation | Turning it off translates on hover, with no confirmation |
| `hoverOnWord` | Not used | Translates the word under the pointer |
| `autoShowPopup` | Not used | Opens the popup as soon as text is selected |

The two settings marked *Not used* are both ways of opening a popup by pointing
at something, which is exactly what `click` mode turns off. They stay in place
and take effect again the moment you switch back to `hover`.

Two more settings tune the timing, in both modes:

- `autoShowDelay` (`350`) — how long after a selection settles the marker
  appears.
- `dragSettleDelay` (`250`) — the same, but for a selection dragged with the
  mouse. VS Code gives extensions no mouse-up event, so a drag is recognised by
  its shape and the release is read as the moment the drag stops moving. Raise
  this if the marker shows up while you are still dragging; lower it if it
  feels slow to appear after you let go.

## Changing languages without opening Settings

- Click the **source** or **target** language name at the top of the popup to
  open a picker. The popup re-translates and reopens by itself.
- The shortcut row under the translation (`vi · en · ja · zh-CN`) switches the
  target language in one click. Edit the list with `quickTranslate.quickLanguages`.
- The ⇄ button swaps source and target.
- Languages you picked recently move to the top of the picker next time.
- Pick **Detect language** in the source picker to go back to `auto`. While on
  auto, the popup shows the language Google detected, marked `(auto)`.

## Commands

All of these are available from the Command Palette under `Translate:`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Translate Selection | Open the popup for the current selection |
| Replace Selection With Translation | Overwrite the selection with its translation |
| Change Target Language / Change Source Language | Open the language picker |
| Swap Source / Target Language | Reverse the direction |
| Copy Last Translation | Copy the most recent result |
| Speak Text | Play the last result as audio |
| Open In Google Translate | Open the text on translate.google.com |
| Set Google Cloud API Key | Store an official API key in the OS keychain |
| Clear Google Cloud API Key | Remove the stored key and return to the free endpoint |
| Clear Cache | Drop the in-memory translation cache |
| Extension Options | Jump to these settings |

## Settings

Everything lives under `quickTranslate.*`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `targetLanguage` | `vi` | Language to translate into |
| `sourceLanguage` | `auto` | Language to translate from, or `auto` to detect |
| `quickLanguages` | `vi, en, ja, zh-CN` | Codes shown as one-click shortcuts in the popup. Set to `[]` to hide the row |
| `popupTrigger` | `click` | `click` opens the popup only when the 🌐 marker is clicked; `hover` opens it when you point at the marker. See [Click or hover](#click-or-hover) |
| `showIconOnSelect` | `true` | Show the 🌐 marker next to a selection |
| `iconPosition` | `auto` | Which side of the selection the 🌐 marker hangs off. `after` puts it past the last selected character — but on a selection that ends at end of line that is the strip GitLens blame, Error Lens and inline suggestions also draw in, and the marker lands behind them. `auto` puts it in front of the selection for those lines, `before` for every selection |
| `showResultIn` | `popup` | Where an answered request is shown. `popup` is the hover; `panel` opens no hover at all and sends the answer to the Translations panel; `both` does the two. Every translation is recorded in the panel regardless — this only decides what is brought up |
| `historySize` | `50` | How many turns the Translations panel keeps |
| `panelLocation` | `secondary` | Which side bar the panel is contributed to — `secondary` for the right-hand bar, `activitybar` for the left. Needs a window reload |
| `popupPosition` | `auto` | Which end of the selection the popup opens at. Every extension answering one position shares the one popup, and the column past the last character of a line is where GitLens answers with its commit card — so `end` on a selection that runs to end of line opens the popup with that card above the translation. `auto` opens at the front of the selection for exactly those lines, `start` for every selection |
| `manualSelectionOnly` | `true` | Only mark selections you made by hand, not ones a command produced |
| `confirmBeforeTranslate` | `true` | Ask before sending a selection, through the marker's own popup. Turn off to translate on the first click (or on hover, in `hover` mode) |
| `autoShowPopup` | `false` | Open the popup as soon as text is selected, without hovering. Only used when `popupTrigger` is `hover` |
| `autoShowDelay` | `350` | Debounce in milliseconds before reacting to a selection change |
| `spinnerAfterDelay` | `0` | Head start in milliseconds a request gets before a spinner popup opens for it. `0` always shows the spinner; raise it and a request that finishes first opens one popup with the translation instead |
| `dragSettleDelay` | `250` | Milliseconds of stillness before the marker appears at the end of a mouse drag. The marker stays hidden for as long as the selection is being dragged out, so this is roughly the pause between releasing the mouse and seeing it |
| `hoverOnWord` | `false` | Translate the word under the cursor even with nothing selected. Only used when `popupTrigger` is `hover` |
| `preserveLineBreaks` | `all` | `all` keeps every line, `paragraph` folds hard-wrapped lines and keeps blank lines, `off` flattens everything onto one line |
| `renderMarkdown` | `true` | Render Markdown tables in the popup as tables |
| `stripCommentMarkers` | `true` | Drop `//`, `/* */`, `#`, `<!-- -->` and indentation before translating |
| `maxLength` | `1500` | Longest selection sent to the engine |
| `showStatusBar` | `true` | Show the current language pair in the status bar |
| `proxy` | empty | Use a different host instead of `clients5.google.com` |

### Why `maxLength` is 1500

The free endpoints carry the text inside the URL, and Google rejects anything
past roughly 16 KB. A CJK character costs 9 bytes once URL-encoded, so Japanese
text hits that ceiling at around 1,800 characters — well before the character
count looks large. Selections beyond the limit report a clear message rather
than a bare HTTP error. Raising this only makes sense with an API key set,
because the official API sends the text in the request body instead.

## Translation engines

**Without a key** the extension calls `clients5.google.com/translate_a/t`, the
endpoint the Google Translate Chrome extension uses, and falls back to
`translate.googleapis.com` if that fails. These are free and need no setup, but
they are **unofficial**: they are rate limited, undocumented, and Google can
change them at any time.

**With a key** every request goes to the official Cloud Translation API v2
instead, and the unofficial endpoints are never called. Run **Translate: Set
Google Cloud API Key** to store one — it is kept in the OS keychain, not in
`settings.json`, so Settings Sync never carries it off the machine and it cannot
be committed to a repository by accident.

Google bills the official API by **source characters sent**, with the first
500,000 characters each month free. For reference, a typical paragraph-sized
selection is 100–200 characters.

### Translating tables

A selected Markdown table comes back as a table rather than as flat lines. This
works because each line is translated as its own request, so the engine never
sees the table as a whole and cannot restructure it — the divider row and every
`|` come back in place.

Detection happens per block, not per selection, so a document holding prose and
a table renders both correctly in one popup. A run of lines is treated as a
table only when Markdown itself would accept it: consecutive rows wrapped in
`|`, with a `| --- |` divider among them. Everything else keeps its own line
break exactly as before, which matters because Markdown reads a single newline
as a space — prose rendered as Markdown would lose the line breaks the
translation just preserved.

Set `quickTranslate.renderMarkdown` to `false` to switch tables off as well.

Note that `stripCommentMarkers` removes a leading `#` before the text is sent,
so Markdown headings arrive as plain text. Turn that setting off too if you are
translating documents rather than code.

Links and raw HTML in the selection are never rendered. The popup is a trusted
Markdown surface where a `command:` link would run a VS Code command when
clicked, and text out of an arbitrary file must not be able to build one.

## Using an API key

### Adding a key

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), pick a
   project and enable **Cloud Translation API**. The API requires billing to be
   enabled on the project, including for the free monthly characters.
2. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key**.
3. Restrict the new key to the Cloud Translation API. An unrestricted key works
   against every API enabled on the project, so anyone who obtains it can spend
   far more than translation.
4. In VS Code, run **Translate: Set Google Cloud API Key** from the Command
   Palette and paste the key. The input is masked.

The status bar keeps showing the language pair; there is no separate indicator
for which engine is active. To confirm the key took effect, translate something
and watch for errors — a bad key fails loudly rather than falling back.

### Where the key is stored

In the operating system keychain, through the VS Code secret storage API — not
in `settings.json`. That means Settings Sync never carries it to another
machine, and it cannot end up in a committed `.vscode/settings.json`.

The old `quickTranslate.apiKey` setting is deprecated. If a key is still there,
it is moved into the keychain the next time the extension starts and then
deleted from every settings scope it was written to. You will see a notification
when that happens.

### Removing a key

Run **Translate: Clear Google Cloud API Key**. Translation returns to the free
unofficial endpoints immediately, and the cache is cleared so nothing is served
from the previous engine.

### Capping what a key can spend

The per-day character quota defaults to **unlimited**, so nothing stops usage
once the free 500,000 characters are gone. Set a cap explicitly:

**APIs & Services → Cloud Translation API → Quotas →** *Characters sent to
general model per project per day*.

A daily limit of **16,000** keeps a project under 500,000 characters even in a
31-day month — roughly 110 paragraph-sized translations per day, shared across
everyone using that key.

Two things to plan around: the quota resets at midnight **Pacific time**, and a
new quota can take **up to 24 hours** to take effect. Set it before handing the
key out, not when you need it.

Once the cap is reached the API answers `403 Daily Limit Exceeded`, which the
extension shows in the popup. It does **not** fall back to the unofficial
endpoints — with a key configured, those are never called.

If several people share one key, this quota is the only thing that sees the
combined total. Nothing on an individual machine can.

## Known limits

VS Code does not let an extension paint an arbitrary HTML popup at the cursor
the way a Chrome extension can. This popup is the editor's native Hover, which
renders Markdown and strips `style`, `class` and `data-*` attributes. That
rules out custom backgrounds and borders, so the layout uses rules and toolbars
instead.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- The 🔊 button opens audio in an external browser rather than playing it inside
  the editor, and Google's text-to-speech endpoint accepts about 200 characters
  per request.
- The 🌐 marker is a decoration, and decorations receive no click events. In
  `click` mode the click is inferred from what it leaves behind — the caret
  landing on the spot the marker occupies — so clicking just inside the end of
  the selection opens the popup too. In `hover` mode the marker instead carries
  its own small popup, whose link is a real click target.

The translation cache holds 500 entries in memory and is not written to disk, so
it starts empty after a window reload.
